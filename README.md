"METRO MAZE" PROJECT'S MAIN GOAL IS TO ASSESS, CREATE, AND PUT INTO PRACTICE AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM THAT CAN IDENTIFY THE FASTEST AND MOST DIRECT ROUTE BETWEEN TWO METRO STATIONS. BY GIVING METRO PASSENGERS ACCESS TO REAL-TIME INFORMATION ON THE BEST ROUTE THAT MINIMIZES TRIP TIME AND DISTANCE, THIS TECHNOLOGY SEEKS TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUTER EXPERIENCE.

PRINCIPAL GOALS:

SHORTEST PATH IDENTIFICATION: WITHIN THE SPECIFIED METRO NETWORK, CREATE ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES TO DETERMINE THE SHORTEST PATH BETWEEN TWO METRO STATIONS.

TIME-EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS: USE REAL-TIME DATA TO EXAMINE THE TRAFFIC SITUATION AT THE MOMENT, THE AMOUNT OF CONGESTION AT THE STATION, AND OTHER PERTINENT ELEMENTS AFFECTING JOURNEY.
DISTANCE OPTIMIZATION: USE ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE THE FASTEST PHYSICAL PATH BETWEEN TWO METRO STATIONS, MAKING SURE THE ROUTE SELECTED MINIMIZES THE TOTAL JOURNEY DISTANCE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SAVING TIME.

DATA VISUALIZATION: UTILIZE GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS, INCLUDING GRAPHS AND MAPS, TO SHOW THE SUGGESTED PATH, OTHER OPTIONS, AND RELATED TIME AND DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS. IMPROVE USER COMPREHENSION AND INTERACTION USING DATA VISUALIZATION.
